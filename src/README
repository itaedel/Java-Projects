Remarks:

The clever player was implemented by going over each row and trying to mark
each column in that row until until the player gets a win streak.
if there are no columns in the row the player will go to the next row.

The genius player was implemented by going over each column starting from the
middle of the board and trying to mark each row, if the column ended and the
player didn't win the colum will advance by one and if we went over the right
half of the board we will go over the left half of the board.

By each player implementing a shared interface we can have different type
of players play a single game when each player has a different strategy to the
game but all have the same function to run a single turn so they can be called
as a "Player" class without knowing or caring what their implementation is.
